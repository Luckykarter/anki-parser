# Anki Parser

POC for converting `apkg` files of Anki to an arbitrary format that can be used on other platforms

The app has no dependencies and uses only Python 3.6+ standard library

### Usage

#### Convert to Quizlet format:

To convert `apkg` to Quizlet format - run `main.py` providing the file to convert:
```
python main.py example.apkg
```
The console output is in Quizlet format that can be copy-pasted to the relevant place (e.g. StudySmarter flashcards)
